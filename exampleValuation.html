Industry: Property and Casualty Insurance
Company Statistics vs Industry-Wide Stats
AmTrust stock has a much better value than the average company stock in the property and casualty insurance industry based off of multiple factors
First, its P/E ratio. Using data off of Yahoo Finance, AmTrust has a P/E ratio of 9.05 compared to the average P/E ratio of 19.1 for other stocks in the industry. Also attractive to the value investor is AmTrust's return on equity, which is 20.43% compared to the industry standard of 9.2%.
AmTrust has a P/B value of 1.98, which is about par for property/casualty insurance companies which, on average, have a P/B ratio of 2.
AmTrust also has strong profit and operating margins, 10.8% and 12.67% respectively, as well as a high quarterly year on year revenue growth of 15.40%.
AmTrust has a dividend yield of 2.36% vs. the industry standard of 2.8%. However, I believe this small difference in price yield is more than made up for by the higher ROE and lower P/E ratio AmTrust has compared to other property/casualty insurance companies.
What exactly does AmTrust do?
AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that, generally, are underrepresented in the insurance market.
The company strategy is to target niche, small and middle-sized customers using in the United States and Europe using a proprietary technology platform to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that they receive.
AmTrust approaches acquisitions conservatively by taking modest balance sheet risks, including acquiring companies, access to distribution networks, and hirings of established teams of insurance underwriters.
Strengths and Future Opportunities
A big strength of AmTrust is its key statistics compared to companies in the industry, indicating that the company stock is undervalued.
Another big strength is the proprietary technology that AmTrust uses, which allows the company to "appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance [their] ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole." Wherever possible, AmTrust adjusts the terms, conditions, and exclusions of their coverage to manage their risk and increase their profitability.
Another part of AmTrust's strength is the fact that the company targets niche customers where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where AmTrust's level of expertise provides them with a distinct advantage over other competitors in the industry.
AmTrust and its principal insurance subsidiaries are rated "Excellent" by an independent organization, A.M. Best Company, an organization that analyzes insurance companies. "Excellent" is A.M. Best Company's third highest of 16 rating levels.
AmTrust's effective and robust policies are shown through the company's high retention rates for its insurance policies, with an average policy renewal rate of 86% for the years of 2014,2013, and 2012.
AmTrust has strong future earnings potential, with analysts predicting that over the next 5 years the company will grow earnings at an average annual rate of 11%. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/earnings-growth
Weaknesses and Risks
AmTrust is currently involved in several class action lawsuits filed in February 2014 in the southern district of New York. According to their 10-K SEC filing, the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss. This lack of loss estimates suggests that perhaps there are potentially large losses at risk and that the company does not want to erode stakeholder confidence. That being said, I believe the claims made by litigators are unsubstantiated. The cases are currently in appeal, but judges have ruled in AmTrust's favor in the past.
Volatile financial markets could adversely affect their business operations, financial positions, and liquidity. In the case of an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could negatively impact confidence in the company.
There are no policy limits on Amtrust's liability for worker's compensation claims unlike other forms of insurance. In the event of catastrophic losses or a force majeure, AmTrust could theoretically be forced to pay out significant amounts of money to the workers they insure.
A large amount of Amtrust's money (About $4.25 billion or 77% of their investment portfolio) is concentrated into fixed income securities. In general, the market value of fixed income securities decrease as interest rates rise. Conversely, when interest rates decrease the market value of the securities increase. According to their filing, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $207.3 million decrease in Amtrust's investments.
Economic Moats
What makes AmTrust much more effective at producing returns and reducing risks is through how its business is structured. AmTrust has three business segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty and Extended Warranty Risk, and Specialty Program. AmTrust's moat comes in its small commercial business side of the company, with its small commercial business segment making up 49.3% of their gross written premium in 2014, 40.3% in 2013, and 34% in 2012.
The small business segment for worker's comp, which continues to increasingly take up a majority of the companie's gross written premium, is less competitive for the large insurance market because of the lower average premium and smaller policy which do not fit the profitability criteria of their customers. This allows AmTrust to work in a niche market that allows them to make money consistently and obtain a portion of the market share that other insurance companies are restricted from.
Analyst Ratings
Although I take analyst ratings with a grain of salt, some people may find them to be insightful. To that end, all of the analyst ratings for AmTrust have been positive. According to: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/recommendations
Out of 5 analysts, 4 gave it a strong buy and 1 gave it a buy.
Overall
I give AmTrust Financial Services a BUY rating based off of several factors: its favorable P/E and ROE, its strong future earnings potential, and the unique way the business is structured to target niche clients in an underrepresented market. I believe the market is currently undervaluing AmTrust because of lower consumer confidence in the financial markets, and that the recent dip in its price is not based off of fundamentals.
